        <p class="subtitle">Founded in 1863, James Young was one of the last great British coachbuilders in the twilight of the coachbuilding era in the 1960s. While most of James Young's work was with the Phantom V, six fixed-head Silver Cloud III coupes were bodies by the company, marking one of the most elegant models of the classic Rolls-Royce era. Powered by a 6.2-liter V8, this Silver Cloud III to over 2,600 hours to complete and was originally delivered to Melville Thompson, Esq. of Northern Ireland. The car received a restoration from a former James Young employee in 1997 and has been in its current collection since 2007. A stunning example of the height of Rolls-Royce luxury, this Silver Cloud goes to auction in Liechtenstein June 2021.</p>
